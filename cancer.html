        <h3> The Specialist in Cancer Care</h3>
        <p class="lead text-justify">According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 20 million people are
            presently living with cancer. It
            is estimated that 70% of new cancer cases in the next decade will occur in low resource countries like
            Kenya.
            This rise can partially be attributed lifestyles factors such as tobacco use, alcohol, industrial
            carcinogens
            and infectious agents.</p>

        <p class="lead text-justify"> In response to this growing challenge, AKUH,N has developed a regional
            Comprehensive Cancer Programme.

            Our range of cancer care services are delivered to international best practice standards, and aim to lead
            the
            enhancement of oncology services throughout East Africa. The services we offer include early detection and
            screening programmes, specialised diagnostics, chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments, as well as
            palliative
            and rehabilitation programmes.</p>

        <p class="lead text-justify">We emphasize rapid access to a multi-disciplinary model of care. Our expert team of
            doctors, nurses, dieticians,
            counselors and pharmacists guides each patient through diagnosis, treatment and recovery.</p>

        <p class="lead text-justify">Using this approach, our personalized treatment plans reflect the combined
            expertise of numerous medical
            professionals, who work together to provide patients and their families with outstanding medical care</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Outpatient Cancer Care</h3>
        <p>
            The Outpatient Cancer Care (OCC) is part of our larger Comprehensive Oncology Program. The facility is
            designed to provide an integrated, patient-centered service accross the care cycle from diagnosis through
            treatment, survivorship and palliative care.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Outpatient Cancer Care also offers streamlined, efficient care by our multidisciplinary team of
            specialists. This coordinated approach allows us to offer all inclusive care to cancer patients and their
            families as a one stop service.
        </p><br><br>
        <h3>Breast Centre</h3>
        <p>
            The Breast Centre offers services to patients with any form of breast problems and to individuals seeking
            information and or breast health education.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clinic also offers breast conservation surgery, an operation done to treat breast cancer with the
            removal of as little breast tissue as possible. This is achieved through a procedure known as Breast
            Conserving Therapy (BCT) where removal of the tumor cells is followed with radiation therapy to the
            remaining healthy cells of the breasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            With modern surgical techniques, BCT has excellent cosmetic results (i.e. treated and untreated breast are
            almost identical or only slight differences) especially with the current use of oncoplastic techniques.

                <h3>Types of Cancer Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many types of cancer treatment. The types of treatment that you receive will depend on the
                    type of cancer you have and how advanced it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people with cancer will have only one treatment. But most people have a combination of
                    treatments, such as surgery with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When you need treatment for
                    cancer, you have a lot to learn and think about. It is normal to feel overwhelmed and confused. But,
                    talking with your doctor and learning about the types of treatment you may have can help you feel
                    more in control.
