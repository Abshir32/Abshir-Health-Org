                    there was care, compassion, and respect. A special thank you to your social workers as well; they
                    provided professional guidance, comfort, and strength to make our own decisions. Finally, I cannot
                    praise the Palliative Care and Hospice team enough. They were patient and helpful. All our hope that

                    wasn’t
                    feeling well and didn’t think we should get on the plane. We were eventually taken to Abshir
                    Hospital. From the moment she was wheeled through the doors of the emergency room, my fears were
                    immediately put to rest. A courteous, compassionate and competent group of people immediately
                    enveloped her in a cocoon of security. I would like to tell you that you should be extremely proud
                    of your staff for the manner in which they treated a frightened pair of senior citizens.""

                    you of my experience.
                    I was very nervous entering the emergency room. My nervousness was reduced when I was greeted with
                    several smiles from your staff.</p>

                   <p class="testimonials"> The doctors and nurses on the Labor Unit were amazing. They were patient, kind, and efficient when
                    answering questions. Their primary goal was to make sure I was secure. I was convinced that they had
                    my best interest at heart and would ensure my safety during surgery. Thanks for hiring such
                    excellent staff.</p>
